Environmental & Crop Stage Factors\n     Warm temperatures (20\u201330\u00b0C) and free moisture (intermittent rain) promote bacterial multiplication.\n     Fruit development stage is critical, as lesions on immature fruit can lead to internal blemishes.\n6.

Disease Overview\nEarly Blight (Alternaria solani) is a fungal disease affecting potato plants, particularly during warm, moist conditions. It targets leaves, stems, and tubers, with severity increasing during tuber initiation when foliage stress impacts yield potential.\n\n2. Symptoms and Signs\n- Irregular, dark brown to black lesions with concentric rings on lower leaves\n- Yellowing (chlorosis) surrounding lesions, leading to leaf necrosis\n- Stem cankers and sunken, dark lesions on tuber surfaces (storage stage)\n\n3. Causative Agent\nFungus *Alternaria solani*, which survives in crop debris and soil. Warm (20\u201330\u00b0C) and humid conditions favor spore production and infection.\n\n4. Transmission and Spread\n- Spores dispersed by wind, rain splash, and irrigation\n- Infection occurs through leaf stomata or wounds\n- Intermittent rain creates repeated infection cycles\n\n5. Environmental & Crop Stage Factors\n- Tuber initiation stage (4\u20136 weeks post-planting) is critical: foliage damage reduces photosynthesis, limiting tuber development\n- Warm temperatures (18\u201327\u00b0C) with free moisture (e.g., dew, rain) accelerate disease progression\n\n6. Management Information\n- **Cultural**: 3\u20134 year crop rotation; remove volunteer potatoes and infected debris\n- **Resistant varieties**: Use cultivars with moderate resistance (e.g., 'Russet Burbank')\n- **Chemical**: Fungicides containing mancozeb (if permitted) or copper-based products (verify local regulations) applied at first symptom detection. Avoid chlorothalonil (restricted in many regions).\n- **Application timing**: Protect foliage during tuber initiation; repeat applications every 7\u201310 days during wet weather\n\n7. Prevention Measures\n- Avoid overhead irrigation to reduce leaf wetness\n- Ensure field drainage to prevent waterlogging\n- Monitor fields weekly for early symptoms\n\n8.

Prevention Measures\n     Ensure proper plant spacing for airflow.\n     Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which promotes succulent growth.\n     Monitor for early symptoms during dry periods.\n8. Stage Specific Notes\n     During flowering, defoliation can lead to reduced pollination efficiency and smaller fruit size.\n9. Weather Specific Notes\n     Dry, warm winds increase transpiration rates, stressing plants and promoting pathogen establishment.\n10. Sources Used\n      Local Knowledge Base (PlantwisePlus, UC IPM).\nNo unsafe practices or unverified chemicals were identified in the sources. All management strategies align with cultural and preventive measures."}
